
"preLaunchTask" never worked for me when defining a task typed 'npm'.
--> error preLaunchTask 'npm: watch' not found when launching with F5

Tried by using the extension code 'helloworld' generated 
with the command 'yo code'.
Tried by launching the task manually (ctrl+B, or with the menu)
Tried by using task labelling, etc. and found only this turnaround :

I defined a "type":"shell" task to be able to auto-launch the 
builder before the debugger.

like this : 

tasks.json : 
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "defaultBuild",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "npm run watch",
            "problemMatcher": "$tsc-watch",
            "isBackground": true,
            "presentation": {
                "reveal": "never"
            },
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            }
        }
    ]
}

in launch.json : "preLaunchTask": "defaultBuild"
